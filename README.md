👋 Hi, I’m @Kabzn (Tomás Andrés Helle Pessot)
👀 About Me
I’m a geologist with experience in hydrogeology and geophysical prospecting. Currently, I'm studying Computer Engineering with a focus on Enterprise Application Development and Cybersecurity, and I’m interested in developing intuitive software for hydrogeological modeling. I balance my time between my professional projects, academic studies, and personal programming interests.

🌱 I’m currently learning
I'm focused on enhancing my programming skills in Python, C, and MODFLOW for modeling and simulation. I’m exploring data analysis and 3D modeling in GIS software, which I apply to my hydrogeological and geological studies.

💻 Work & Projects

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on
I’m open to collaborating on hydrogeology-related applications, game development, and open-source projects related to water resource management or geospatial analysis.
